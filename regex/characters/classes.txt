character class: a built-in set of characters.

character classes start w/ a '\'.

kinds of character classes:
1. decimal digits: '\d'.
2. whitespace: '\s'.
3. word (latin letter in any case, decimal digit or underscore): '\w'.
4. any character except '\n': '.'.

inverse character classes are complements to the aforementioned sets:
1. anything but decimal digits: '\D'.
2. anything but whitespace: '\S'.
3. anything but a latin letter in any case, decimal digit or underscore: '\W'.
