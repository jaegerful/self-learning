there are three variations of unicode, each of which represents its range of characters:
1. 'utf-8': encodings are one-to-four bytes each.
2. 'utf-16': encodings are one-to-two words each.
3. 'utf-32': encodings are a doubleword each.

in 'utf-8', encodings that are four bytes long are known as 'surrogate pairs'.

unicode is backwards-compatible w/ ascii (but not extended ascii).
