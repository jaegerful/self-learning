how to execute a file:

python sample.py

the above command does two things:
1. executes file with __name__ set to '__main__'.
2. prepends the pathname of current working directory to the 'path' environment variable.
3. uses 'path' to locate imports in file.

a package is a directory with an '__init__.py' file.
'__init__.py' can be empty.

every file has a fully qualified name.
a fully qualified name includes every package the file is nested under, separated by periods.

how to execute a built-in or third-party module:

python -m outer.inner.utilities

the '-m' flag does two things:
1. lets us provide the fully qualified name of module in terminal. the 'path' environment variable is then used to locate it.
2. every import in module must start with a package.

how to create a virtual environment:

python -m venv container
