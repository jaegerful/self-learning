origins consist of three parts:
    1. scheme
    2. hostname
    3. port (default: 80)

in other words, origins are pathless urls.
when request made from website, the 'origin' header is included. in this header, path of url is not included.

browsers append a forward slash to searches that simply consist of origins.
in other words, the path is '/'.
