origins consist of three parts:
    1. scheme
    2. hostname
    3. port (default: 80)

browsers append a forward slash to searches that simply consist of origins.
in other words, the path is '/'.

when request made from website, the 'origin' header is included.
in this header, the path of the url is not included.

origins comprise a subset of urls. urls are anything that starts w/ '[a-z]+:'.
